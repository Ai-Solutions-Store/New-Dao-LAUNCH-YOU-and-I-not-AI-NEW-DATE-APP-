## MANIFESTO (Brand Story)

"In a world racing toward automation, we choose intention.

Where algorithms curate, we create.
Where AI generates, we craft.
Where machines optimize, we humanize.

This is not a rejection of technology.
It's a celebration of what makes us human.

Every product in our collection is made by human hands,
designed by human minds, and created for human connection.

We believe in the power of craft.
The beauty of imperfection.
The value of thought.

This is the anti-AI movement—refined.

Welcome to YouAndINotAI."

## PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

### Premium Positioning Tactics:

### Price Anchoring:
- Show most expensive items first (makes others seem reasonable)
- "Premium Collection" vs "Essential Collection" tiers
- Limited edition items at 2x normal price (anchors perception)

## SUSTAINABILITY MESSAGING

### Avoid Greenwashing:
- Be specific: "Organic cotton grown in Turkey, printed in California"
- Show the process: Behind-the-scenes of production
- Admit imperfections: "We're on a journey, not perfect yet"

### Circular Economy:
- Product take-back program (recycle old tees for discount)
- Repair services for leather goods
- Donate portion of profits to human-centered causes
